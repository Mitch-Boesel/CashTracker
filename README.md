# CashTracker
Personal project of mine. The application provides statistics, graphs, and other metrics for monthly and yearly spending.
Incorporates a ReactJS frontend, .NET Core Web Api backend, and a PostgreSQL database. 
Can be ran locally or over a docker network using the dockerfiles and docker-compose file, depending on configuration.
